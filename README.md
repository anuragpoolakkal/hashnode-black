# Hashnode Black Theme

This is a custom CSS stylesheet for Hashnode that provides a truly black background for your blog. The stylesheet also includes additional features, such as hiding the top right profile icon, follow button, newsletter button and the footer area to make the blog minimal.

## How to Use

To use this stylesheet, follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste `home.css`, `article.css`, and `pages.css` in their respective sections in Blog settings -> Appearance -> Edit Custom Stylesheet.
2. Hit 'Save Styles' and preview your design before making it official.
3. Play with the CSS and find your perfect theme.
4. Publish changes when you're ready.

Please note that not every style in these sheets is necessary to achieve the same result. Some of them are not needed but kept without removing. You can experiment with them if you want by removing ones you think are not necessary.

## How to Contribute

If you want to contribute to the sheets and make them better, you're welcome to do so. Here's how:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make changes.
3. Open a pull request with a neat description.
