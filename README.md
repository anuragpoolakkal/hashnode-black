# Hashnode Black Theme
I wanted my Hashnode [blog](https://anuragrajanp.hashnode.dev) dark theme to be truly black, yes #000000. After hours of work, I achived everything I wanted by customizing CSS in Hashnode's Custom CSS. I'm posting this because I don't want anyone else to spend hours to achieve the same as I did.

I did not changed anything in light theme as I am satisfied with the current colours.

Not every style I made in this is not necessary to achieve the same result. Some of them are not needed but kept without removing. You can experiment with them if you want by removing ones you think not necessary.

This stylesheet provide additional features than just a true black background in your blog, including:
- Hide top right profile icon for both dark and light themes
- Hide footer area

### How to use
Copy and paste home.css, article.css and pages.css in respective sections in Blog settings -> Appearance -> Edit Custom Stylesheet. Hit 'Save Styles' and preview your design before making it official. Play with the CSS and find your perfect theme.
